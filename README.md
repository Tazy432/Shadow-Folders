# Shadow folder
This is a very simple program that clones a folder/directory in real time . For example , let us consider 2 folders/directories A and B . We chose A , as the folder that 
needs to be cloned , and B as the "shadow folder of A" . When running up the program , all the changes that happen inside A , happen in B aswell . If before the start of 
the program , A has 2 files inside , and B is empty , after starting the program , those files will be duplicated in B.This happens in real time as long as the application
is running .
